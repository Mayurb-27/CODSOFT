# CODSOFT
Welcome to my Codsoft internship repository! This repository contains three C++ projects that I worked on during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases different aspects of C++ programming.

## Guess the Number Game

This project is a simple interactive game where the user tries to guess a random number generated by the computer. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low, making it an enjoyable way to practice basic programming concepts and user input handling.

## Simple Calculator

The Simple Calculator project is a console-based application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input two numbers and choose the desired operation to perform. This project demonstrates the use of user input, conditionals, and switch statements in C++.

## Student Grading System

The Student Grading System project allows users to input student names and their corresponding grades. The program calculates and displays the average grade, along with the highest and lowest grades among the students.
